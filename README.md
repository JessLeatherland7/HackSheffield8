# HackSheffield8 Entry

I participated in a 24-hour hackathon where my team created an Android app to motivate users to track their day-to-day sustainability. The user needs to track eco-friendly actions to save Benji the polar bear from a terrible fate when his iceberg melts. This project has been uploaded from another account, so the version history is not available, but the commits from the original repository are shown in the snapshots below. The project was completed in collaboration with @ChristinaW44, @saba-vaez and @annaprokop.
